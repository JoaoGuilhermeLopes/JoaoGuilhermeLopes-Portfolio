                <p>
                    I am an aspiring computer hardware and software engineer.<br>
                    My excitement for this new world of technology is massive, therefore I would love to be part of this evolution 
                    where the sky is the limit and creativity can go as far as the imagination can reach. 
                    I enjoy experiencing the process of how the computers are continuously evolving at a fast pace, 
                    either withing the hardware or software side, whether it's quantum computing, optical computing or some other technology. 
                    In order to keep up with this progress, I am always open to learning new skills and gaining knowledge
                    by challenging myself to be part of this digital revolution.

                    <p>
                        This project consists on automaticly drawing a graph represented by the values available to draw the graph,
                        the sand required to fill the present gaps between the collums and the top cap of each collum. <br>
                        These graphs could be displayed vertically or horizontally and saved in a CSV.txt file if desired. 
                        Also, the values to draw the collums could be obtainned by reading CSV.txt files already available, inputing them manually or randomly generating them.<br>
                        After possessing the complete graph the system would automaticly calculate the amount of "sand" required to fill 
                        the present gaps in between the collums and display it, asking then if the user would like for the program to be repeated.

                <p>
                    This project was implemented based on a STM32F746 board with built in display that controls the environment around a room such as 
                    temperature, lights, door locks and curtain position. <br> These were implemented around the main microchip that would be responsable for
                    exchanging information from the secondary circuits (and all its components), displaying and manipulating them in real time with the GUI developed.<br>
                    All this system was developed to be fully automated, interactive and versatile depending on the users preferences.

                <p>
                     In this project, it was built a Java client-server application around a predefined SQLite database.<br>
                     This system would allow the user to manage their wine collection and all its respective details such as 
                     name, variety, designation, country, between others. It would also allow to add / remove wines in the database
                     or even write / get a reviews about them.<br>
                     All of this funcionallities were used in a simulated server space where the information could be transfered from / to 
                     different users simultaniously, and these could connect or disconnect from the server as desired in order to access the available data.

                    <h1>Java Restaurant Booking Database - Java</h1>
                <p>
                    Similarly with the previous project (Wine Database), this project consists on about the same structure about a java client-server
                    application, but this time the system would be based on a restaurant booking database leading then for the implementation of certain extra features.<br>
                    To start, it was required to create custom SQLite databases in order to add specific details,
                    also certain improvements were made such as booking status, status management pop-ups,
                    date / time chooser, search for costumers, meals and waiters options and print button.<br>
                    The development of this new project and its additional features and code optimisations were implemented in this
                    new self-made project with the intention to challenge myself
                    to do better and to develop a real world application.
